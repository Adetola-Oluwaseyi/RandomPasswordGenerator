## Random Password Generator

Generates a random password consisting of letters (capital and small), numbers and symbols.  
The length of the password is chosen by the user.

We humans include personal information in our passwords, information that can easily be found and used by cybercriminals to crack them.  
This application aims to solve that.

> Note: The application is in its first iteration; I'd come back to it soon.


### Possible future additions to the application

* do the private, public thingy for the methods in the classes
* use random.system thingy to get truly random values
* write the password into file
* use the print function to alert them to delete the file immediately
* use a time function to automatically delete a created password a period has elapsed
* and other things not yet written here...
